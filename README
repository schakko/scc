scc (ServiceConsoleControl) starts stops and restarts Win32 services with all dependencies	to other services.
Take the following example:

Examples
========
Service A depends on B and B depends on C.
	
	scc stop B 
scc stops A and afterwards stops B

	scc stop C
scc stops A, stops B and stops C

	scc start A
scc checks C (will be started if not already started), scc checks B (will be started if not already started) and starts C.
